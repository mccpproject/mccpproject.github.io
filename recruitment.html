                    <p class="classic-formatting">Welcome to the <b>Tentoria</b> Recruiment page! We're currently looking for voluntary builders to assist in the creation and maintentence of the project. The whole idea
                    of the project is to host a <b>Minecraft Server</b> based around the core concept of <b>Social MMO games</b> such as <b>Club Penguin</b> while mixing in the classic <b>Arcade</b>
                    format of today's Minecraft networks like <b>Mineplex, Hypixel, The Hive,</b> etc. In order to achieve a perfect representation of our vision, we need a <b>Massive</b> map to be created
                    with plently of detail. On top of that, we need <b>High-Quality</b> Arcade maps to ensure the Arcade games look great. Maps for games such as <b>Murder!</b>, <b>Spleef</b>,
                    <b>Balloon Wars</b>, and many more unique games!</p>

                    launches! At this point in time, there are <b>3</b> types of Builder roles. 2 Being specialised and 1 being a mix of both. All 3 of them are open.</p>
                    <p class="classic-formatting">When applying, <b>You Will Need</b> some form of <b>Portfolio</b>, a <b>Minecraft Java Account</b>, and a <b>Discord Account</b>. Don't bother applying without those 3 core

                        Games which blend seamlessly with the surrounding biomes with only a barrier and an NPC breaking them up from the main world.
